TODO:  Convert dfClass to pandas monkeypatch

Tools to help with Data Science related projects

* dfClass: Very simple python class that takes a loaded pandas DataFrame as its argument, and allows you to call inherent features of the df such as its dimensions, completeness and description of numerical attributes

* dfFuns: Same functionality as dfClass, except written as a function.  The function executes all of the attributes of the dfClass in one go.
